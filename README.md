## Description

This project allows users to search for a city and display the current and future weather conditions. As a user, I want my search history logged. The weather conditions display the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index. When the user views the UV index, then they are shown a color that indiciates three stages: favorable, moderate, or severe. When the user views the future weather conditions for the specified city, then the user views a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of the weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity. When I click on the search history and choose a city, then I am again presented with current and future conditions for the searched city.
